How it works:
	to load the app right click on the .ps1 file and run it with powershell,
	to close the app just click the X on the right top corner.


Prerequisits:
	ActiveDirectiry and SHOWUI modules.
	*To import AD module you have to install RSAT
	(PS C:\Users\elib> import-module activedirectory)
	(PS C:\Users\elib> Install-Module showui)
	
Debugging:
	get the script out of the "PowerShell.exe -windowstyle hidden { }", then you'll be able to view the console.
